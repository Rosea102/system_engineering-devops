This directory contains Bash scripts focused on loops, conditionals, and input parsing. It is part of my journey to mastering shell scripting and DevOps automation.  
In this project, I'll be practicing using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops, implementing conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`, and learning how to handle and parse user input.
